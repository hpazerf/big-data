# big-data
* Using different big data techniques 
* Worked on these projects in a group of two including myself

## Apache Spark
* Used Apache Spark, a Map -Reduce Framework, to create a song recommendation system for a given big dataset 
* Looked at different uses of Apache Spark such as faster and optimized query execution for the given big dataset

## Machine Learning using AWS
* Connected a Jupyter Notebook to AWS using an EC2 instance
* Compared running simple machine learning models within AWS and a local machine

## Machine Learning using TensorFlow
* Used Neural Network modeling to compared to models using a CPU, GPU, and TPU
